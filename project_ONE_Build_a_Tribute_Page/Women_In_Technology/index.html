            <p>She became the first computer programmer by designing the first computer algorithm, and explaining how it would work on Babbage’s proposed (but non-existent) Analytical Engine.</p>

            <h2>Jean Bartik and five other women </h2>
            <p>  They developed and codified many of the foundations of software programming while working on ENIAC. The six women, whose software work was crucial to its operation and success, were not invited to the dinner celebration for the completion of ENIAC. </p>
           <p>   When the project was eventually introduced to the public in 1946, the women were never introduced or credited for their hard work -- both because computer science was not well understood as an emerging field, and because the public's focus was on the machine itself

            <p> She created one of the world’s first compilers (in her spare time). </p>
            <p>She envisioned code to use English language-based instructions, and her programming language design work led to the creation of COBOL, used to this day.</p>

 </h2>
            <p> She briefly worked for Microsoft, Susan Kare is best known for her work in apple. </p>
<p>
Kare - “The morale is to have confidence in your skill mix,” she later said. “Because I certainly didn’t have a computer background.”
            </p>
            <p>
Designed icons that were simple, elegant, and playful. The original designs were just 32 x 32 pixels. Responsible for developing the command (“Apple”) key as a stylized castle seen from above.</p>
<p>
Created the typeface Chicago, used in the first four generations of the iPod. To keep the lettering smooth and seamless, all lines were purposefully made horizontal, vertical, or on a 45-degree angle. That sort of attention to detail has continued to define Apple to this day.</p>
